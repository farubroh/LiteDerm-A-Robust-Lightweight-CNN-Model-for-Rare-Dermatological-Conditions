   <p>This repository contains the research paper, <strong>"LiteDerm: A Robust Lightweight CNN Model for Rare Dermatological Conditions,"</strong> which introduces a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed for the classification of five uncommon skin diseases: acne, vitiligo, hyperpigmentation, nail psoriasis, and SJS-TEN.</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The automation of skin disease diagnosis can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce the strain on medical systems. LiteDerm is a lightweight CNN model developed specifically for rare dermatological conditions, achieving a remarkable performance of <strong>99.20% training accuracy</strong>, <strong>99.06% validation accuracy</strong>, and <strong>99.02% testing accuracy</strong> on a dataset of <strong>9,548 dermatoscopic images</strong>. This model not only competes with top architectures like ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and ConvNeXt but also requires significantly fewer parameters (<strong>6.6 million</strong>) for efficient computation.</p>

   <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High performance</strong>: Achieved <strong>99.02% testing accuracy</strong> with only <strong>6.6 million parameters</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Compared to traditional models</strong>: LiteDerm outperformed <strong>ResNet-50</strong>, <strong>InceptionV3</strong>, and <strong>ConvNeXt</strong> across multiple performance metrics (training, validation, and testing accuracy).</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient</strong>: The lightweight design allows for <strong>rapid inference</strong>, making it suitable for use in low-resource environments such as mobile devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Domain-specific design</strong>: Specifically designed for <strong>dermatological image classification</strong>, improving model accuracy for rare skin diseases.</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Skin disease diagnosis</strong> for rare conditions like acne, vitiligo, hyperpigmentation, nail psoriasis, and SJS-TEN.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical applications</strong>: Rapid, accurate detection of dermatological diseases in real-world healthcare infrastructure, especially in underdeveloped regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-resource environments</strong>: Applicable for real-time skin disease classification on mobile and low-resource devices.</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The proposed lightweight CNN outperforms conventional models across all metrics:</p>
